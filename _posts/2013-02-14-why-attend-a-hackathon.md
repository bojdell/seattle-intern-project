“The word hackathon is a portmanteau of the words hack and marathon, where hack is used in the sense of playful, exploratory programming.” -Wikipedia

For those of you not familiar with hackathons, they are marathon coding events focused on shipping a demo of an innovative concept; the goal is to start from scratch and end with a working prototype. Generally, these events last from 24-48 hours and are filled with food, caffeine, prizes, and, you guessed it, more caffeine. After time runs out, teams demo what they’ve built and compete for prizes. Over the course of the weekend, hackers learn how to work with new technologies, throw together tons of code, and hopefully finish what they set out to build.

Over the past year, many universities have hosted massive hackathons. Examples include <a href="http://hackmit.org">HackMIT</a>, <a href="http://pennapps.com">PennApps</a>, and <a href="http://mhacks.org/">MHacks</a>. Hackathons in the Bay Area are of a different flavor; they tend to be smaller and most are hosted by one company or venture capital firm. 

**So why should you attend one of the many Bay Area hackathons?**

Hackathons provide a venue for self-expression and creativity through technology. People with technical backgrounds come together, form teams around a problem or idea, and collaboratively code a unique solution from scratch — these generally take shape in the form of websites, mobile apps, and robots.

Tons of innovative concepts have come from hackathons. A notable example of a hackathon “hack,” GroupMe is a group messaging app that was acquired by Skype for over $50 million. Other notable examples include the Facebook “Like” button and Facebook Chat, which were both first demoed at internal company hackathons.

Despite the complete lack of sleep, these events are addicting, and the community building around them is growing faster than ever. Instead of meeting at a coffee shop or conference to discuss the world’s problems every weekend, you’ll find many of these students at a hackathon tackling them head on.

There is no better opportunity to meet and work alongside some of the brightest interns in the Bay Area. Over the course of a weekend, you'll meet tons of friends, many of whom you will run into again and again on the university hackathon circuit.

We highly recommend the Greylock Hackfest, if you have any hackathon experience. You have to apply to get in, but it is one of the most best-run and fun hackathons over the summer.

If you've never been to a hackathon, don't worry! There are plenty of first-timers at any of the hackathons over the summer. If you're an intern in the Bay Area, you **definitely** know enough to go. Try one out, we promise you'll have fun!
