## TL;DR - Live in San Francisco, Mountain View, or Palo Alto.
- San Francisco a real modern city: there’s lots to do and see, a strong artsy/hipster-ish/design-friendly feel, and a ton of startups located in or near the SOMA district.
- Palo Alto is a picturesque suburb that is very clearly a college town: beautiful nature, a reasonable amount of good food and events going on, lots of start-ups but are nowhere near as busy as San Francisco.  Mountain View is a less upscale version of Palo Alto, with a wealth of amazing Asian food and Bubble Tea.
- Living anywhere else in the Bay is going to be cheaper, but almost certainly increase the length of your commute both to work and to almost any event.

### Why San Francisco
If you want a well-rounded summer, San Francisco means that there is a ton to explore around the city without going to the same place twice, from dive bars to fantastic restaurants, to Dolores Park to Mission Burritos.  San Francisco is young, trendy, and expensive.

**Where to live in SF**: [Breakdown of neighborhoods](http://www.thebolditalic.com/drewhoolhorst/stories/1958-moving-to-san-francisco) and [accompanying map](https://hood.theory.org/map.html).  Being near a BART or Caltrain stop is a good idea.  Living near MUNI is good too, especially if you don’t plan to get a bicycle.  Some areas of SF are sketchy as hell (Tenderloin, parts of the Mission).

### Why Mountain View or Palo Alto
Some friends of mine bash MTV as being a dead town, but I don't necessarily agree - Castro Street has some fantastic food, and so long as you know other interns/people in tech, you're not going to be bored. Same for Palo Alto.  Neither of these places will demand a summer to *explore* the same way San Francisco does, but if you’re more interested in the company you keep than the places you congregate, you’re going to have a great time.  I did.

**Where to live**: Try to live within 15-minutes from a Caltrain stop if you don’t have a car.  Hint: buying a bicycle dramatically increases said radius.  Also: [East Palo Alto](https://foursquare.com/v/the-ghetto/4beb53a0b3352d7fd26856d2) is not Palo Alto.  Don’t live there.

**Note** - I also hear Berkeley falls in this ‘reasonable place to live’ category, but I have never lived there and can’t speak of it first hand.

### Why (not live) anywhere else
If you don’t mind living further away from one of the central locations, you’ll be able to pay half as much for rent for a nicer place than you could afford otherwise [(see heat map)](https://www.kwelia.com/maps/public/sfbay).

Saving money is great and all, but your commute length will go up, the amount of interaction you’ll have with interns you meet will go down, and you’ll spend overall more time than you have this summer just figuring out how the hell to get somewhere.  Not as bad if you have a car.

**Particular places to avoid**: North San Jose and Oakland, but there are probably more.


## Finding housing
**Word of warning: this is going to be more painful than you expect it to be, even taking into account [Hofstadter’s Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter's_law)**
### Where to look
- If your company offers you housing, seriously consider taking it. There's so much less work involved that way.  Even if they don't, ask your recruiter if they have any suggestions or places they know of, and whether they can help.
- Start looking through [Craigslist](http://craigslist.org), but probably not directly: instead, use [PadMapper](http://padmapper.com) and [LiveLovely](http://livelovely.com), as well [Airbnb Sublets](https://www.airbnb.com/sublets) for alternate available sublets. Subscribe to email notifications for places that become newly-available; a lot of places are going to go in a matter of hours.
- [This post](https://www.facebook.com/groups/210814239033807/243098055805425/) on the 2013 Intern Group suggests potential sources of Alternate Housing.
- In particular, [Chez JJ](http://chezjj.com/) offers what is basically a high-end hostel for techies. Chez JJ and other hacker houses are probably not going to give you your own room unless you pay extra, but the other people staying at hacker houses (at least as Chez JJ) make it well worth it.
### Team up with roommates
- Find other interns from your school and try to find housing together. Warning: finding housing for more than about 4 people, especially as time draws near, is a challenge.
- Join the [2013 Summer Intern Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/210814239033807/) and add yourself to the [roommate search](https://www.facebook.com/questions/251394174975813/?qa_ref=qd) poll.
### Best Practices
- Make sure to check out a place’s [Walk Score](http://walkscore.com) before agreeing to live there and aim for 75 or above.
- Watch out for Craigslist scams. If you can't make it out and check out the place, maybe a friend (or somebody at your company) could do you a favor and meet the future landlord in person.

## How much should I expect to pay?

**Sigh.**  More than either one of us would like.  Be prepared.

In San Francisco, if you're willing to share a bedroom or have a small place, or not have a great location, you should be able to find something for $1,200 or so.  If you want something in a better location, or a newer building, or don't want to spend a lot of time searching, be prepared to pay $1,500 to $2,000.  If you find good housing for less than $1,200 a month, you got lucky - take it immediately.

Palo Alto is roughly 20% cheaper than SF, and Mountain View is another 10% cheaper than Palo Alto [(see heat map)](https://www.kwelia.com/maps/public/sfbay).

## PS: Should I live in SF and commute down to the Bay for my job?

San Francisco is a more vibrant, busier place than South Bay.  Every year, a good number of interns decide to live up north and commute every day, either by Caltrain, car, or provided (Apple, Facebook, Google) shuttles.  The question is whether the better location justifies the longer commute.

### Pro
- There’s more to do in San Francisco
- Plenty of time to catch up on podcasts or read, or talk to fellow commuter friends

### Con
- Consider about an hour of your day eaten up by the commute, every day.
- Longer commutes are seriously unhealthy: [(research)](http://healthland.time.com/2012/05/08/long-commute-your-heart-and-waistline-may-suffer-for-it/).

** Rule of Thumb **:
On average, do you intend to go out on more than one weeknight per week? If so, live in San Francisco.
