**You**: a CS student looking for your first or second internship <br />
**Them**: Somebody you're contemplating working for <br />
**This**: The sort of checklist one creates after hearing enough internship horror stories

***Modeled after the [Joel Test][1]***

1.  **Do you already have technical people on staff?**

    Regardless of your title, the first technical guy at a start-up is never really 'an intern'.  If you’ve never done web/mobile/whatever development before, being the first technical hire for a ‘business founder’ start-up is <del>a mixed bag</del> almost certainly an error.  Especially for your first experience, having a qualified technical mentor makes a big difference for how quickly you pick things up and whether you learn to do things ‘the right way’ the first time around or not.

    There’s a whole class of developers out there that have picked up PHP/Javascript from sketchy tutorials that get the job done but result in sloppy/outdated code.  Googling around is a great way to learn, but having a competent technical mentor point you to the right/best practice/reputable tutorials and explain things early on is the difference between having a piano teacher set your posture or a cursive teacher ensure your handwriting is legible early on.

2.  **Who is going to be working directly with you?**

    Before taking any job, meet the person you are going to be working with most directly and take them out for coffee (or Skype). Ask them about:

    * **Culture Fit** Software engineering attracts all kinds of people; talking to your future potential mentor helps make sure that the two of you are going to match.  There’s absolutely nothing wrong with not being able to easily get along or fit with somebody, and you’d rather find out that you’re going to be the odd one out in a company now than have to deal with it for the rest of the internship.
    * **Mentorship experience** Has your future mentor done this before?  It’s fine if they haven’t, but bonus points if they’ve had an intern before.  It also helps if the mentor has ever themselves been technically mentored by somebody - they know first hand what it’s like to be in your shoes. **Ask**: What worked well in your last technical mentor-mentee pairing?  What kind of issues surprised your or would you want to change when we work together?

    [Eric][1], my mentor for summer 2011, started our first day at work by asking what I was hoping to get out of the internship.  This stumped me for a good fifteen minutes; it was a fantastic question that helped crystallize our professional relationship and help us structure our work accordingly - “Alexey, you mentioned you had hoped to get more exposure across the stack. Do you want to work on the CSS for the new page we’re building?”


3.  **Will my code matter?**

    One of the greatest joys of writing code is seeing your code ship and be useful;  having users benefit from your design decisions feels great. If at all possible, make sure the code you will be writing meets that bar.  There are (at least) two reasons it may not: internal software or dead software:

    **Internal**: Joel Spolsky described the [Five Worlds of Software Development][2] almost a decade ago. Internal software doesn’t have to be well written or engineered; it is typically written quickly and then left to (hopefully) still work.  There’s a ton of ‘internal’ or ‘good enough’ software in academia and start-ups, and being able to be good at writing prototypes or good-enough software is a useful skill; just make sure that it’s not all you ever do.  At some point, make sure you get to work on code that needs to be great and not good enough; the amount you’ll learn about software engineering and code readability is drastically different.

    **Dead**: Most start-ups fail; your code may never see the light of day.  Even at big companies, one of my friends had her project cancelled half way through her internship for unrelated reasons.  There’s no clear way to keep your code from being part of vaporware; the best that I can recommend is to follow your gut: does the project you’re considering joining seem like it’s going to happen with or without you, or is everybody living on a prayer?

4.  **Who had my job before?**

    If your potential employer has had interns before, ask to talk to them about their experience for a reference check.  If a potential employer is trying to dodge the question of past experience, that’s a huge warning sign.

5.  **What are the expected outcomes of our work?**

    You’re looking for two types of outcomes: first, a particular set of skills through the job, and second, products that you can point to and say “I built that,” or “I built this part of that."

    **Skills**: What languages/frameworks/libraries are we going to be using?  Do my mentor/boss/co-workers know these technologies well, or are we going to be picking a lot of them up as we go? There’s nothing wrong with having to pick up something new, (in general, most every project you do will probably involve learning to use a new library of some sort) but having somebody on the team with domain-specific experience helps.  Make sure you understand what technical skill-set in particular you are going to pick up, and then check that the technology you are learning is the kind being used at the places you want to work.  As of March 2013, I’d personally recommend picking up some of [Android/iOS development, Coffeescript, Node, some of the heavier JS frameworks (Ember, Meteor, Angular), Ruby, Python, or (for extra credit Scala or Clojure)].

    **Resume**: One of your tasks as a CS graduate is to build a reasonable one-page resume/portfolio/github account showing off your credibility to potential employers for the summer or full-time.  Be careful not to spend a year working on a project you can’t ever talk about.  **Ask**: is this work I will be able to point to online?  Will I be able to show the source code to potential employers?  Are there any parts of my work that I can open source and stick on my github profile? The answer will be ‘yes’ more often than you expect.

6.  **What is the format/schedule for this job?**

    Does the company want you in at 9AM every day? Do they expect you to check in with your boss before leaving? Is there a daily meeting of some sort? Companies -- even startups -- will vary in their level of formality and in how intensely they care about procedure versus outcome. If you thrive on protocol and none is given (or vice versa), you'll be less happy than you could be.

7.  **How often will we have code reviews or pair programming?**

    If all you do is write code until it works and then submit it, there’s no real mentorship going on; you’re just a short-time employee.  Mentorship means that you are getting feedback on your code consistently; even if less than 100% of your check-ins are being reviewed. Not every start-up can afford to do 100% code reviews the way that Microsoft, Google and Facebook can, but skimping on code reviews entirely is not acceptable.  Alternately, pair programming with your mentor means that you get to ask questions during your collaboration and absorb the kinds of little tips and tricks that are mostly passed down through apprenticeship.  Best practices for pair programming as mentorship is worthy of its own blog post, but the one tip I’d have is make sure the mentee has the keyboard for the vast majority of the time.

    Code reviews or pair programming; potentially both.  If you’re getting neither, you’re not learning any more than you would be if you were working alone.

8.  **How will I be compensated for my work?**

    Compensation for internships has its [own blog post](http://alexeymk.com/dont-take-your-highest-paying-internship-offe/index.html), but the TL;DR is: make sure you're being compensated fairly (at least ~$2500/month to cover living expenses), but don't just accept your highest paying offer because of the money.

    If your financial situation allows for it, I’d pick at least your first or second part-time job entirely based on how much better of a developer the job will make you, and worry about the money later.  Even if your sole focus is financial gain, a solid but unpaid internship pushes your lifetime value forward far more than a well-paying dead-end part-time job.

    The difference between a great and a mediocre job/internship is huge.  I learned more in 3 months at Facebook than I did in 3 years as a software engineer in the Israeli Defense Forces. On the flip side, the benefit of a paying job means that the company is invested in you.

9.  **What if they offer equity?**

    > Whatever they offer you, equity or salary, ask for the other one

    I can’t find the source of this quote, but it reasonably sums up the best practice here.  The start-up is making a choice about compensation: whatever thing (equity or cash) they don’t give you is the thing they consider more valuable, and therefore the thing you should be more interested in obtaining.  I remember emailing a web-developer who was a mutual friend when I was starting out and offering to work together.  All was well until I offered equity ‘as compensation’.  I never heard back.

    Start-ups throwing around equity offers left and right in lieu of payment are a pretty good ‘tell’ for amateurishness, especially given how favorable the current climate is to entrepreneurs wishing to raise early-stage capital. In general, I think I agree with [Eric][3], who considers the equity component of his compensation to be a lottery ticket - nice to have, but not to be depended on.

    There’s no hard and fast rule for whether to accept equity as early-stage payment or not, but ‘no’ is a pretty reasonable default. “Either pay me for my work or show me how I’m going to get mentorship from this position,” is not an unreasonable answer at all; don’t be afraid to use it.  For the less confrontational, a simple “I’d love to work with you, but I’m on financial aid and need a steady income” is a completely reasonable excuse.
