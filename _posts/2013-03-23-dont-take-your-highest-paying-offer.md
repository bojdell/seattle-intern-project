### Don't do that.

It's easy to focus on the financial aspect of an offer, especially if it's the first time you've had a chance to make anywhere near this much. It's the most quantifiable aspect, and the sheer amount feels kind of surreal.

It's not that money isn't a valuable proxy for how valuable the company perceives you to be. If you get an offer limited to "housing + we give you options in the company" that's a good sign that you are talking to [Whartonite Seeks Code Monkey][1]-esque enterpreneurs and if you have anything remotely more interesting available you should go do that instead.

But the point of an internship is not to maximize your profits - it's to [learn what kind of work or industry you want to be in once you graduate][2], to try things out and live in cool places, and (more immediately) learn about how real-world software engineering works.

When you go out into the real world with six figures worth of college loans, you should negotiate your offer. The difference between $80k and $100k a year will make a substantial difference in how soon you will be free from debt.  But when you are deciding where to spend your summer, the difference of a few $K is a small price to pay for learning about a potential industry or position or company that you are interested in as a career.

## PS: Salary Ranges for Internships
(***These are estimates, and were roughly accurate at some point in 2011. Sending in corrections is much appreciated***)

*   ~$10k/month - crazy financial hedge-funds where they have you do algorithms trading or something along those lines. Expect +$2k/month for every greek letter in their name.

*   ~$7.5k/month - Google. I think Google still makes a point of paying 10-20% more than anybody else, but I haven't checked recently. Edit: Palantir appears to be in this bracket as well.

*   ~$6-7k/month - Facebook, Dropbox, Twitter, Microsoft, Apple, etc - top-tier tech companies.

*   ~$4-6k/month - Various smaller companies and legit startups.  I think normal finance-tech jobs are in this range as well.

*   ~$2-4k/month - Less prestigious (or non Bay-Area) start-ups or small tech firms.

*   ~$0-2k/month - Summer of Code, non-profit work, non-funded or silly start-ups.


** Note: I'm including housing in all of these. **

Keep in mind that a number of these companies also adjust by year, more willing to pay a rising senior than a rising freshman.  I've seen this be a factor of up to 50%.
