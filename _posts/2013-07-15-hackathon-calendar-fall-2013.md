- Sept 6-8: [PennApps](http://pennapps.com). Philadelphia, PA. 40 hours.

Reasons to go: Been around for a while (this is v7 of PennApps), it's a giant event (450+ in the Spring, expecting 900 this time), $10k grand prize and travel reimbursements from (really) places as far away as Japan and Switzerland. _The_ student-run hackathon. Plus, nerf guns.

- Sept 20-22: [MHacks](http://facebook.com/MHacksHackathon). Ann Arbor, MI. 24 hours.

Reasons to go: The contender.  Started in Feb 2013, with 500+ hackers in attendance and aiming for 1,000 this time around.  According to David Fontenot, "The Most Epic Hackathon. Ever."

- Sept 28-29: [HackNY](https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/fall-2013-hackny-student-hackathon). New York, NY. 24 hours.

Reasons to go: Organized by HackNY, a non-profit by professors from Columbia & NYU dedicated to keeping hackers off the (Wall) Street.  Every semester since 2010, so this would be v8.  Great hacker community and a chance to see New York at 5AM when you throw your hands up and wander around looking for doughnuts.

- Sept 27-29: [UOfTHacks](http://uofthacks.com). Toronto, Canada. 36 hours.

Reasons to go: Starting a hackathon, eh guys? First time event featuring seminars, workshops and a keynote.

- Oct 4-6: [HackMIT](http://www.hackmit.org). Boston, MA. 24 hours.

Reasons to go: Over $5,000 in prizes, plus a chance to beat an MIT on their home turf (or, if you go to MIT, defend your honor). Up to $200 travel reimbursement. October is v2, v1 seems to have 200 hackers in February 2013.

- Oct 11-13: [BoilerMake](http://www.getinvolved.purdue.edu/organization/computerscienceundergraduatestudentboard/calendar/details/257720). West Lafayette, Indiana. 36 hours.

Reasons to go: Purdue sent over 50 hackers to MHacks last spring, and now they're hosting their own. Details still forthcoming.

- Oct 12-13: [HackRU](http://www.hackru.org). New Brunswick, NJ. 24 hours.

Reasons to go: Rutgers CS students are an unbelievably creative bunch. They've been throwing this event since 2011, and they're a solid bunch.

- Nov 8-9: [Y-Hack](http://www.y-hack.com/). New Haven, CT. 24 hours.

Reasons to go: $10k in prizes, $100 travel reimbursement. Like MIT, Yale is really stepping up their game this time around. Nothing like a little Ivy League rivalry to keep Princeton on their toes.

- Nov 8-10: [HackPrinceton](http://hackprinceton.com). Princeton, NJ. 48 hours.

Reasons to go: Since 2011. Featuring a dedicated Hardware Hack Track and what is apparently an unbelievably gorgeous campus.

- Nov 15-16: [HackTX](http://hacktx.com/). Austin, TX. 24 hours.

Reasons to go: This is v2; and v1 started strong with 250 hackers. Everything is bigger in Texas.
